## API
The app is using the Ticket Master API described below:

As this app is a Demo purposes project, the call will be placed for my next trip ðŸ˜Š â€‹


## Architecture
The app is using the suggested MVVM architecture separating the data access repository in a new module.
You can find a lot of tools inside this project as:
- JetPack compose components: Paging, Navigation, MotionLayout
- Architecture components: ViewModel, LiveData, Room
- Third-party libraries: retrofit, glide, Timber, Espresso

### Other considerations
- Multiple flavors: debug, preprod, release
- Databinding
- Unit and instrumentation testing.
- CI/CD with GitHub actions

```java
